    <!--Font at 20px works best for formatting and can also work with margin style rules I set above for spacing-->
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I am a Junior at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business.

        I am passionate about building products that make lives easier and meaningful, combining strong technical depth with practical impact.
        
        Whether it is designing AI-assisted analytics tools or creating intuitive web applications, I enjoy turning complex ideas into solutions that are both useful and accessible.
        
        Ultimately, I’m driven by the goal of making a positive change through technology and innovation.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> My approach is detail-oriented and collaborative: I focus on solving problems at their root while ensuring the solutions are maintainable and easy to use. When I am not coding, I enjoy mentoring peers, learning about new business models, and exploring ways technology can improve everyday workflows.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> I am always open to learning new things, connecting with others, and exploring new and innovative ideas. Please feel free to reach out if you have anythong you would like to discuss or oppurtunities that might fit me best! Excited to meee you all!

    <h2>Consultant Intern - evolv Consulting</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">At evolv Consulting, I developed an AI-powered chatbot using JavaScript (Node.js) and Snowflake Cortex that enabled employees to query internal datasets using natural language and receive real-time, SQL-generated responses with citations. This tool streamlined internal data access and empowered business users to get insights without writing SQL.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I designed backend workflows for prompt routing, semantic search, and text-to-SQL integration, contributing to reusable, scalable data services. I also resolved critical API authentication issues (401 errors) by debugging token scope configurations and optimizing local environment management to support both individual and team deployment workflows.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">During development, I worked with TensorFlow to address deployment and compatibility issues within the chatbot's AI pipeline, ensuring reliable model performance and integration with Snowflake Cortex. This experience deepened my understanding of machine learning model infrastructure and cloud-based deployment strategies.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In addition to engineering, I contributed to a strategic case study for a bank, helping identify and map high-impact Snowflake use cases across Finance, HR, Marketing, and Operations. I supported the creation of a multi-phase roadmap and ROI model that tied foundational efforts in data ingestion, governance, and training to long-term enablement of AI, automation, and real-time analytics.</p>

    <h2>Software Development Intern - Yasme Soft Inc.</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">As a Software Development Intern at Yasme Soft Inc., I worked on a wireless machine condition monitoring project for a major automobile manufacturer, contributing to the company’s smart manufacturing transformation. I collaborated closely with IoT solution architects, data engineers, and industry SMEs to help deliver scalable, real-time machine monitoring capabilities in a production setting.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I was responsible for developing and testing a Java-based data ingestion pipeline to process real-time sensor telemetry from factory machinery into cloud-integrated systems. My work supported the broader effort to implement predictive maintenance and real-time diagnostics for manufacturing equipment.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In an Agile environment, I authored user stories and technical requirements in Jira, helping facilitate backlog grooming, sprint planning, and effective cross-team collaboration. I also created and executed test scripts to support business users in validating end-to-end data flows and ensuring production readiness.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">This role provided hands-on exposure to AWS IoT Core, Agile delivery, software development life cycle (SDLC) best practices, and the core principles of smart factory architecture—positioning me to contribute meaningfully to the intersection of cloud infrastructure, industrial IoT, and software engineering.</p>
